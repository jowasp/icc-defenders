Well, I will answer your question about the Mandro training centre. When we got to Mandro, the leader was Mr Mugisa Muleke he was the one who supervised the  training centre in Mandro. That is where all the recruits were. But he reported to Mr Ntaganda. There was also a number of instructors, former commanders such as  Abelanga, Mutegaji. There were many instructors who worked together, one taking over from another. I didn't know all their names. There were many instructors. I didn't know exactly how they divided up the work, but each one of them had a particular component of training to give. Some taught how to handle weapons, others taught guerilla warfare and strategy. I know that all the instructors were at the same level, but their superior was Muleke and he reported to Bosco Ntaganda. That is what I learned once I had got to the training centre.
